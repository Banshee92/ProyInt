# ProyInt
This is a project made by students from the EAFIT university.

The purpose of this project is to find correlations between the different variables analized during a technical-mechanical revision for cars in Colombia.
You'll find 3 Data Lake Zones, Raw, Curated and Refined in which you'll find the different transformations made to the Data for this project.
To be able to run this project you'll need to download the notebook and the data set found in the Curated Zone, since this project is independent of AWS.
